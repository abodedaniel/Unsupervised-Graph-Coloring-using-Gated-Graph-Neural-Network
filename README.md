# Unsupervised-Graph-Coloring-using-Gated-Graph-Neural-Network
In this repo, we show an unsupervised graph coloring method using gated graph neural network. The graph coloring problem is formulated as a multi-class node classification problem. The graph neural models are based on pytorch geometric library.
